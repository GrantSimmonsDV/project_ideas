Idea: 
An app that allows people within a local community to trade their personal services or skills with one another, creating a win-win without involving monetary exchange. 
Community members create an account stating on their profile the skills/trades that they can offer help with as well as potential needs they have themselves. Based on the user’s profile, when the user logs in, other community members are displayed that are either a full match (listed needs and services of the user and community member are mutually beneficial) or a partial match (community member’s listed service meets user’s need or vice versa). Partial matches have the option to negotiate to create a working arrangement. In-app communication enables users to arrange the details of the exchange.
